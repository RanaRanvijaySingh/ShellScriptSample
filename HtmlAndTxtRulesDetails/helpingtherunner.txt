APPROVED RULING 

AR 7.5.A 
With fourth-and-goal from B's 1-yard line, runner A1 is pushed at the line of scrimmage from behind by A2 in an effort by A2 to get him into the end zone. RULING: A2 has fouled by helping the runner. The foul carries a 5-yard penalty. Therefore it will be fourth-and-goal from B's 6-yard line if the penalty is accepted.
