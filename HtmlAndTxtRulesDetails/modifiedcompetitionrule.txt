When a team scores to take a 30-point lead any time in the second half, the trailing team gets the ball at the opponent's 40-yard line; if at any time in the second half the deficit is reduced to fewer than 30 points, traditional rules take effect. If the 30-point deficit occurs at the start of the second half, the trailing team begins the second half in possession at the opponent's 40- yard line even if the leading team was to receive the second-half kickoff.
